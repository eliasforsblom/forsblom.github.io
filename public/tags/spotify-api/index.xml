      <description>Inspired by the incredible post &amp;ldquo;Using Data to Find the Angriest Death Grips Song&amp;rdquo; by Evan Oppenheimer (Link in the end of this post) I decided I also would play around and get acquainted with the spotify API and at the same time get to better my skills in data science overall.&#xA;Going into this &amp;ldquo;project&amp;rdquo;, and even by the time of starting to write this post I had no idea of what I actually wanted to do, so the first thing I did was to explore the spotify API to see what options i had and if there was someting that I would find intereseting to dig deeper into.</description>
