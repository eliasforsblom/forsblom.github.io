      <description>Or just a silly comment made by rival football fans?&#xA;2 months ago the 2020-21 seasons champions league group stage was drawn and both on pubs and on the internet you could hear and read about Manchester citys - once again - shockingly easy draw. Trying to be as unbiased as I can as a Chelsea supporter I looked at the 2020-21 drawings as well as previous drawings and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help feeling that Manchester citys groups the past 4 years do seem to be suspiciously easy, but from experience I am also aware that just looking at the different club names trying to form an opinion without being biased is quite hard if not impossible, especially looking a couple years back trying to remember how great a specific club was that specific year.</description>
