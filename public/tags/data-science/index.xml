      <description>financeR, a R wrapper which makes it easier to access and download stock data in bulk&#xA;Itâ€™s been quite some time since I posted on this blog now, and the reason for that is - except for a lot of school - that I spent almost all my spare time developing an R package which ended up being quite time consuming and a lot bigger than I first expected. The package, or wrapper, I developed is called financeR and is something I developed to make it easier to - hint: the name - download and conduct analysis on large amount of stock data using the Financial Modelling Prep API.</description>

      <description>Inspired by the incredible post &amp;ldquo;Using Data to Find the Angriest Death Grips Song&amp;rdquo; by Evan Oppenheimer (Link in the end of this post) I decided I also would play around and get acquainted with the spotify API and at the same time get to better my skills in data science overall.&#xA;Going into this &amp;ldquo;project&amp;rdquo;, and even by the time of starting to write this post I had no idea of what I actually wanted to do, so the first thing I did was to explore the spotify API to see what options i had and if there was someting that I would find intereseting to dig deeper into.</description>
