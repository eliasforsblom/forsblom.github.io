      <description>financeR, a R wrapper which makes it easier to access and download stock data in bulk&#xA;Itâ€™s been quite some time since I posted on this blog now, and the reason for that is - except for a lot of school - that I spent almost all my spare time developing an R package which ended up being quite time consuming and a lot bigger than I first expected. The package, or wrapper, I developed is called financeR and is something I developed to make it easier to - hint: the name - download and conduct analysis on large amount of stock data using the Financial Modelling Prep API.</description>

      <description>Inspired by the incredible post &amp;ldquo;Using Data to Find the Angriest Death Grips Song&amp;rdquo; by Evan Oppenheimer (Link in the end of this post) I decided I also would play around and get acquainted with the spotify API and at the same time get to better my skills in data science overall.&#xA;Going into this &amp;ldquo;project&amp;rdquo;, and even by the time of starting to write this post I had no idea of what I actually wanted to do, so the first thing I did was to explore the spotify API to see what options i had and if there was someting that I would find intereseting to dig deeper into.</description>

      <description>Or just a silly comment made by rival football fans?&#xA;2 months ago the 2020-21 seasons champions league group stage was drawn and both on pubs and on the internet you could hear and read about Manchester citys - once again - shockingly easy draw. Trying to be as unbiased as I can as a Chelsea supporter I looked at the 2020-21 drawings as well as previous drawings and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help feeling that Manchester citys groups the past 4 years do seem to be suspiciously easy, but from experience I am also aware that just looking at the different club names trying to form an opinion without being biased is quite hard if not impossible, especially looking a couple years back trying to remember how great a specific club was that specific year.</description>
