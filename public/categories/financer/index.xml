      <description>financeR, a R wrapper which makes it easier to access and download stock data in bulk&#xA;Itâ€™s been quite some time since I posted on this blog now, and the reason for that is - except for a lot of school - that I spent almost all my spare time developing an R package which ended up being quite time consuming and a lot bigger than I first expected. The package, or wrapper, I developed is called financeR and is something I developed to make it easier to - hint: the name - download and conduct analysis on large amount of stock data using the Financial Modelling Prep API.</description>
